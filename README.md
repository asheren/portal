# Portal

Based on the [How I start](https://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1) post, this is a simple elixir practice application to learn some of the syntax and structure I've been reading about.

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `portal` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:portal, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `portal` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:portal]]
    end
    ```
